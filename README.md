### Recent Projects

I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in my spare time by writing a terminal-based text editor, [ped](https://github.com/davidledwards/ped). This led to the development of simple command-line utilities, [keyb](https://github.com/davidledwards/keyb), which echoes bytes generated by keystrokes, and [tcolor](https://githubcom/davidledwards/tcolor), which displays ANSI colors on the terminal.

During the COVID lockdown, I decided to learn a bit more about electronics. This eventually led to building an [Arduino-based GPS-synchronized clock](https://github.com/davidledwards/gps-clock) (hardware and software) of which five generations have since been released.

I also enjoy learning new programming languages when I have time to invest. In doing so, I typically port my [RPN compiler and interpreter](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn) that was originally written in Scala. The most recent languages were Kotlin and Clojure with ports of the original project [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-kotlin) and [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-clojure), respectively. The next language on deck is Rust.
