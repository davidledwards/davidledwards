### Recent Projects

Since the COVID lockdown, I decided to learn a bit more about electronics. I am currently building an [Arduino-based GPS-synchronized clock](https://github.com/davidledwards/gps-clock).

I'm also lazily working on updates to a [ZooKeeper CLI](https://github.com/davidledwards/zookeeper) to incorpoate recent enhancements to the latest ZooKeeper server. My CLI project was started years ago to achieve two objectives: first, to implement a nontrivial purely functional Scala program; second, to radically improve upon the undeniably horrendous user experience of an application, `zkCli.sh`, that shipped with ZooKeeper. Seriously, this is a much better CLI. And, it looks as though the maintainers of ZooKeeper have taken a hint and incorporated some of these features. If anyone is interested in taking over this project, please reach out to me.

I also enjoy learning new programming languages when I have time to invest. In doing so, I typically implement my [RPN compiler and interpreter](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn) that was originally written in Scala. The most recent language is Kotlin with a port of the original project [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-kotlin).
