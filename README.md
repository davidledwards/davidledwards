### Recent Projects

I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in my spare time by writing a terminal-based text editor, [ped](https://github.com/davidledwards/ped). This led to the development of a simple command-line utility, [keyb](https://github.com/davidledwards/keyb), to echo bytes generated by keystrokes.

During the COVID lockdown, I decided to learn a bit more about electronics. This eventually led to building an [Arduino-based GPS-synchronized clock](https://github.com/davidledwards/gps-clock) (hardware and software) of which four generations have since been released. In what was perhaps a serendipitous encounter, an electrical engineer hailing from Moldova found this project and made an online connection. Our ongoing collaboration has led to a number of improvements in both hardware and software.

I'm also very lazily working on updates to a [ZooKeeper CLI](https://github.com/davidledwards/zookeeper-cli) to incorpoate recent enhancements to the latest ZooKeeper server. The CLI project was started years ago to achieve two objectives: first, to implement a nontrivial purely functional Scala program; second, to radically improve upon the undeniably horrendous user experience of an application, `zkCli.sh`, that shipped with ZooKeeper. Seriously, this is a much better CLI. And, it looks as though the maintainers of ZooKeeper have taken a hint and incorporated some of these features. If anyone is interested in taking over this project, please reach out to me.

I also enjoy learning new programming languages when I have time to invest. In doing so, I typically port my [RPN compiler and interpreter](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn) that was originally written in Scala. The most recent languages were Kotlin and Clojure with ports of the original project [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-kotlin) and [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-clojure), respectively. The next language on deck is Rust.
